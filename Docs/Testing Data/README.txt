I have turned on File Sharing so that I can copy out Core Data (and other data) files from one app and transfer them to another. See https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6029916/how-to-enable-file-sharing-for-my-app

Once you have turned this on, and built the app, you can use the iTunes (aka Music) app on your MacOS system to copy files into/out-of the app:

1) Plug your iPhone into your Mac
2) Select your device
3) Tap on Sync Settings... > Files
	and you should get a Finder window enabling you to access the files.
