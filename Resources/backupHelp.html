<h1 style="font-size:3em">Purpose of the Backup</h1>
<p style="font-size:2em">
The backup is intended to help you recover if you have data loss.

The backup is not intended to help you synchronize the WhatDidILike app data across multiple devices. E.g., suppose you backup your data on one device, and then restore using WhatDidILike on a second device. At this point, you must decide whether you want to continue using the app on the first or second device. DO NOT continue to use the app on both devices, make changes, to places/locations and other data and expect good results. No support is providing for merging changes across multiple devices.

<h1 style="font-size:3em">iCloud Drive Backup</h1>
<p style="font-size:2em">
If you select an iCloud Drive folder as the backup destination, the backup will later be available at https://icloud.com on a desktop computer or via the Files app on your mobile device.
Backing up to iCloud (or some other cloud backup) is preferred-- as opposed to a non-cloud backup, just on your device. With your backup in the cloud you should be able to restore even if you lose your device or if your device has a problem.
</p>

<h1 style="font-size:3em">Non-Cloud Backups</h1>
<p style="font-size:2em">
If you select a non-Cloud destination for your backup, your backup will not be stored off the device. This would mean your backup would have limited use. E.g., if your device were to be lost or if you broke your device, you'd lose the backup.
</p>

<h1 style="font-size:3em">Remove backup place when place removed?</h1>
<p style="font-size:2em">
This switch in Settings defaults to "No". This means, if you have made a backup, and then delete a place from the Places screen the place will <em>not</em> be removed from the backup. This can be useful to provide an "undo"-- your last backup will still have the data removed from the Places screen.
If you change the switch in Settings to "Yes", then if you have made a backup, and delete a place from the Places screen the place <em>will</em> be removed from the backup.
</p>

<h1 style="font-size:3em">Space Requirements</h1>
<p style="font-size:2em">
After a back up, the space taken up on your device by this app will be doubled. For example, if you select an iCloud Drive backup, and the app currenty takes up 500MB in data size, after the backup, 500MB * 2 = 1GB space will be used.
