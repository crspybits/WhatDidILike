    BACKUP / RESTORE
    
        * Test production data against backup using UI comparison tool.
            - Remove data from iCloud.com
            - On the simulator, use Debug -> "Trigger iCloud Sync"
            a) Load production Core Data into app
            b) Do an export
            c) Remove app
            d) Do a restore
            e) Do a compare of core data against export
            f) Expect: "Same!!"

        * Test to ensure backup works after removing cloud data. Steps:
            a) Backup the place data to, say, iCloud
            b) Go to iCloud.com and remove that data.
            c) Force a sync (e.g., in the simulator: Debug -> "Trigger iCloud Sync").
            d) In Settings, try a "backup" again. All places should get backed up.

ANY BUILD

    BACKUP / RESTORE
    
        * Test restarting a backup after cancelling it midway through.
        
        * Test iCloud sync on an iPhone with my full data set
            - How long does it last prior to the message that the sync was successful?
            - Does the spinner stay up for the duration? i.e., is it clear that the sync is taking some appreciable time? (It takes about 5 seconds on an iOS simulator).

        * For release, have to make sure that iCloud container is named
            iCloud.com.WhatDidILike (not iCloud.com.WhatDidILike.beta)
