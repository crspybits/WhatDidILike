    BACKUP / RESTORE
    
        * Test production data against backup using UI comparison tool.
            - Remove data from iCloud.com
            - Sync within the app-- Hmmm. This seems wrong. A bug?
                The sync uses the place export folders. By its nature, removing the data from
                iCloud ought to start removing those place folders. So this is something of a race condition. How long before the cloud data on the device starts getting updated?
            a) Load production Core Data into app
            b) Do an export
            c) Remove app
            d) Do a restore
            e) Do a compare of core data against export
            f) Expect: "Same!!"

    BACKUP / RESTORE
    
        * Test restarting a backup after cancelling it midway through.
        
        * Test iCloud sync on an iPhone with my full data set
            - How long does it last prior to the message that the sync was successful?
            - Does the spinner stay up for the duration? i.e., is it clear that the sync is taking some appreciable time? (It takes about 5 seconds on an iOS simulator).
