import Foundation

// Exporting: Per place, need to save JSON of Place and sub-objects. And save files associated with place (i.e., image files).

// Need id/key's for places. Simplest to just use integers. Need to do a migration to establish. And for subsequent place creation assign next highest. Need this for file or folder names when exporting to make names unique.

// Need to have modification date on a Place updated when ever any of its children change. Or have a way to compute this. That modification date is to enable backing up of changed places to storage.

// Need a UI to enable user to control this import/export.

// DONE: Need a mechanism to compare two places for equality-- presumably something like a tree comparison.

protocol ImportExport {
    // The names of the large image files, within the relevant directory.
    var largeImageFiles: [String] {get}
