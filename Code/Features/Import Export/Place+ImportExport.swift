        If needed, images are copied into the large images directory in the Documents directory from the place export directory.
        Two types of uuid collision can occur as a result of this call:
        1) The creationDate of the colliding uuid in the imported place differs from the creationDate in the core data Place it is colliding with. In this case a new necessarily different ("real") UUID is allocated. Really, this is the (albeit) unlikely event that when creating the new Place object, a real UUID collision occurred. Saves the place returned before returning.
        2) The creationDates are the same. In this case, nil is returned and no Place managed object is created.
