        If needed, images are copied into the large images directory in the Documents directory from the place export directory.
        Two types of uuid collision can occur as a result of this call:
        1) The creationDate of the colliding uuid in the imported place differs from the creationDate in the core data Place it is colliding with. In this case a new necessarily different ("real") UUID is allocated. Really, this is the (albeit) unlikely event that when creating the new Place object, a real UUID collision occurred. Saves the place returned before returning. In addition, the place export directory is renamed to reflect this new UUID.
        2) The creationDates are the same. In this case, nil is returned and no Place managed object is created.
        
        `testing`-- If you set this to true (for debug builds only), then (a) no place UUID conflict resolution is done, and (b) images from export are not copied into app.
        
        On an import failure, a cleanup is done so Core Data objects remain and no files remain from attempted import.
