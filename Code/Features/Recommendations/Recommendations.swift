/* Recommendations, aka, suggestions. I'm going to make these place-based. I'm doing this because I assume that each location of a place is similar, and all data for locations for a place combine together. Each location of a place will share the same recommendation value. Suggestion values are >= 0. Larger suggestion values mean they are more highly recommended.
